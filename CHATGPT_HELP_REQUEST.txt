Hello! I'm having trouble starting a React development server on Windows 11 and need help troubleshooting.

**MY SETUP:**
- Windows 11 (build 10.0.26200)
- Node.js version: v16.20.2
- npm version: 8.19.4
- Shell: PowerShell
- Project location: C:\Scripts\Kids\Maayan\EnglishTest

**WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO:**
Start a React app created with create-react-app (using react-scripts 5.0.1)

**THE PROBLEM:**
When I run `npm start`, I get this error:

```
> vocab-game@0.1.0 start
> react-scripts start

'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

**WHAT I'VE TRIED:**

1. ✅ Ran `npm install` - it completed successfully
2. ✅ Verified node_modules exists with 619 packages
3. ✅ Confirmed react-scripts folder exists at: .\node_modules\react-scripts
4. ✅ Tried `npm install --force` - completed
5. ✅ Tried `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` - completed
6. ✅ Tried `npx react-scripts start` - didn't work
7. ✅ Tried running directly: `node .\node_modules\react-scripts\bin\react-scripts.js start`
8. ❌ None of these successfully start the server on port 3000

**OBSERVATIONS:**

- When checking `Test-Path .\node_modules\react-scripts` → Returns TRUE
- When checking `Test-Path .\node_modules\.bin\react-scripts.cmd` → Returns FALSE
- No node processes are running after attempts to start
- Port 3000 is never in use/listening
- No compilation happens, no "Compiled successfully!" message
- Browser never opens automatically

**PROJECT STRUCTURE:**
```
EnglishTest/
├── node_modules/          (619 packages installed)
├── public/
│   └── index.html

│   ├── index.css
│   ├── App.js
│   └── VocabGame.jsx
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
└── postcss.config.js
```

**PACKAGE.JSON SCRIPTS:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

**KEY DEPENDENCIES:**
- react: ^18.2.0
- react-dom: ^18.2.0
- react-scripts: 5.0.1
- tailwindcss: ^3.3.2

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Why would `react-scripts` be installed in node_modules but not recognized as a command?

2. Why is the .bin folder missing react-scripts.cmd?

3. Is there something specific to Windows/PowerShell that's preventing the npm script from finding react-scripts?

4. Should I try a different approach entirely?

5. Is Node v16.20.2 compatible with react-scripts 5.0.1, or do I need to upgrade Node?

**WHAT I NEED:**

Working commands or steps to successfully start this React development server on Windows PowerShell so that:
- The server starts on localhost:3000
- The app compiles successfully
- I can access it in the browser

Thank you for any help you can provide!
